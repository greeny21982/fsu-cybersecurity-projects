## ðŸ“¡ Part 1: Wi-Fi Security Analysis

### Tools & Platforms:
- wigle.net
- Wi-Fi scanning tools

### Key Activities:
- Captured SSIDs and analyzed wireless networks around the Shore Building.
- Compared encryption standards (WEP, WPA, WPA2).
- Investigated why some networks run at 11 Mbps vs 54 Mbps.

### Key Takeaways:
- WEP is outdated and vulnerable due to weak key sizes and predictable IVs.
- WPA2 with AES encryption is the current standard for secure Wi-Fi.
- Channel selection and interference impact network performance.

## ðŸ§… Part 2: Tor Network Exploration

### Tools Used:
- Tor Browser
- IP address comparison tools

### Key Activities:
- Compared IP addresses in regular vs Tor browser sessions.
- Investigated how Tor relays (entry, middle, exit) anonymize traffic.
- Discussed the importance of HTTPS even when using Tor.

### Key Takeaways:
- Tor uses onion routing to anonymize user traffic.
- HTTPS is still essential to protect data after it exits the Tor network.
- Relay servers help obscure the origin and destination of traffic.

## ðŸ§  Reflection Questions

- **Why use Tor?**  
  To maintain anonymity and privacy online, especially in restrictive environments.

- **Why still use HTTPS with Tor?**  
  Because Tor only encrypts traffic within its network â€” HTTPS ensures end-to-end encryption.

- **What are relay servers?**  
  They forward encrypted traffic through multiple nodes, each decrypting only one layer.

## ðŸ§¾ Conclusion

This lab provided insight into wireless network security and anonymous browsing. It emphasized the importance of strong encryption protocols and the layered approach to privacy offered by the Tor network.
