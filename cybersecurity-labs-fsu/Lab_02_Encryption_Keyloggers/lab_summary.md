## üîê Part 1: File Encryption & Secure Deletion

### Tools Used:
- **PeaZip**
- **AxCrypt**

### Key Activities:
- Created an encrypted `.exe` file from a `.txt` file using PeaZip.
- Explored the ability to encrypt multiple files and entire directories.
- Discussed the importance of secure deletion and the use of shredding tools to prevent file recovery.

### Key Takeaways:
- Encrypted self-extracting files are useful for securely sharing sensitive data without requiring the recipient to install additional software.
- Even encrypted files can be vulnerable if previous versions are not securely deleted.
- Tools like AxCrypt include built-in shredders to prevent recovery of deleted files.
