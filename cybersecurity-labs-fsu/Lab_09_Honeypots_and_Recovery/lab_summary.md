## 🐝 Part 1: Honeypot Deployment and Analysis

### Tools Used:
- **HoneyBot**

### Key Activities:
- Deployed a honeypot and monitored incoming connections.
- Logged activity after visiting a suspicious IP address.
- Captured FTP login attempts and analyzed attacker behavior.

### Key Takeaways:
- Honeypots with more open ports are more attractive to attackers.
- Skilled hackers can detect honeypots by analyzing traffic patterns or identifying known honeypot signatures.
- Honeypots are also used to trap spammers by placing fake email addresses on websites.

## 💾 Part 2: File Recovery with Recuva

### Tool Used:
- **Recuva**

### Key Activities:
- Recovered a deleted `.png` file from the system.
- Analyzed file metadata and condition.
- Saved and reviewed the recovered image.

### Key Takeaways:
- File recovery success depends on the file’s condition (e.g., fragmentation, overwriting).
- Recuva can recover files from formatted or damaged drives and external devices.
- It can also search for deleted files by name, if metadata is still intact.

## 🧠 Reflection Questions

- **Do law enforcement agencies use honeypots?**  
  Likely yes — honeypots are a common tool for tracking cybercriminal behavior.

- **Can honeypots run on mobile devices?**  
  Possibly, depending on the phone’s capabilities and the software used.

- **Why is file condition important for recovery?**  
  The more a file is overwritten or fragmented, the harder it is to recover.

## 🧾 Conclusion

This lab demonstrated how honeypots can be used to attract and study malicious activity, and how forensic tools like Recuva can recover deleted files. It highlighted both offensive and defensive aspects of cybersecurity — deception and digital forensics.
