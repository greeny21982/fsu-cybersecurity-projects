## üñ•Ô∏è Part 1: macOS Log Analysis

### Tools Used:
- **macOS Terminal**
- **Console.app**

### Key Activities:
- Used Terminal to interact with `.dmg` files and system logs.
- Explored Console.app to search and filter system logs.
- Identified errors, faults, and system events related to application usage.

### Key Takeaways:
- macOS logs provide detailed insight into system and application behavior.
- Logs can track failed login attempts, application usage, and system events.
- Tools like Console.app allow filtering and exporting logs for analysis.

## üîê Part 2: NIST 800-171 & Security Baselines

### Reference:
- [NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/spurity controls for protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).
- Emphasizes access control, audit logging, incident response, and system integrity.
- macOS security baselines can be aligned with NIST standards using tools like GitHub‚Äôs `macos_security` repo.

## üî¢ Part 3: File Hashing & Integrity

### Key Activities:
- Discussed how to calculate hashes (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) for files.
- Explored how hashes can verify file integrity and detect tampering.

### Key Takeaways:
- Hashes are unique digital fingerprints for files.
- Comparing hashes before and after transfer ensures data integrity.
- Longer hashes (e.g., SHA-256) offer stronger protection against collisions.

## üß† Reflection Questions

- **Can logs track remote login attempts?**  
  Yes, logs can capture both local and remote login events.

- **Why track Microsoft Office usage?**  
  For auditing, productivity monitoring, or license compliance.

- **Can a hacker hide file changes?**  
  Yes, by modifying logs or using fileless malware techniques.
